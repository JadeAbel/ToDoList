# ToDoList

## Rather than ToDo, these are reminders of what not to do <3

Project Title: ToDo List (To Don't - Things to avoid.)

Description: This list has the basic functionality that you'd expect with a ToDo List. You can remove current items and add to the list.

Usage: List making

HOW TO RUN: Open the index.html file on your browser. You may need to clone this repository to your machine.

Support: Email jade.marie.abel@gmail.com

Roadmap: In the future, this list could be retitled and restyled to suit other needs. This file could be easily transitioned into a grocery list, etc.
